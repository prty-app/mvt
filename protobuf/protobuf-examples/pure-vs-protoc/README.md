# rust-protobuf-example

Example rust protobuf project

(This is an example for the master branch. For protobuf=v2.19 look at the
[same directory in v2.19 branch](https://github.com/stepancheg/rust-protobuf/tree/v2.19/protobuf-examples).)

## Motivation

Simple and obvious examples for using `rust-protobuf` module were lacking, so this was created.

## Look here

Key files to read are:

* src/protos/example.proto
* src/main.rs
* build.rs

## Using

Standard rust package:
```
$ cargo build
$ cargo run
```
